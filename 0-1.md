# Release 0.1

This is the next release of the 'Wall Planner' application. 

## Paint catalog update

Make changes to the paint catalog to make it more of a web store feel. users should be able to goto the catalog, fill a basket with paint (from paint catalog they should be able to search for or otherwise find the paint they want and add a quantity of this to the basket) and then save as a bundle which can then be assgined to a project or remain as a standalone bundle.

If a bundle is added to a project, all users that are memebrs of that project, or members of a group which is a memeber of the project, will have access to that bundle. 

Users should have CRUD access to their bundles.

- [ ] A user can fill a basket with paint in the paint catalog or from projects 
- [] users should be able to clear baskets, see the running totoal cost of the basket, remove items or quantities or items, etc - anythignyou'd expect from a normal web store experience 
- [ ] a user can at any point save a basket as a 'bundle'. Once created as a bundle, users should have CRUD acess via the UI to their own bundles and those in projects they are a memeber, manager or owner of.
- [ ] Admins need CRUD access via UI to all bundles however this should be via either the user or project interface, not the paint catalog (although admin users should have CRUD via the UI for their own bundles and those in projects they are a memeber, manager or owner of)

##  Projects update

- [ ] Instead of having seperate view and edit buttons, just viewing a project should take you to a UI you can edit in
- [ ] assign project manager from dropdown of users who are a memeber of the project.

### ART uploads

A project is a mural or piece of art, so we need to give peopel the tools they need to plan a piece of art.

- [ ] project members need the ability to upload images to the project, these can be photos, sketches, or photos that inspire the art. They need a UI within the project to do this. Types of image should be sepereate
- [] project memebers have CRUD via UI for all images they upload
- [] admins can delete any art from a project and  project managers, and project owners can delete any art in their projects
- [] make some sensible choices on file type validation. All must be images or some kind. 

## üî¥ Critical Bugs (Breaking the app)
- [ ] 


## üü° Non-Critical Bugs (App works but has issues)  
- [ ] 

## üìù Notes
- We have had complains that the UI looks old and clunky. The focus of this release it to make the web app's interface as user fiendly as possible. If we need to comepletly redesign it, then do it or if you need mor einfo to make a decisions ask questions, summerising pros and cons.
- We spent too much time/money troubleshooting the last release so I want you to think more carefully about the big picture. For example, make pages more standardised. check things like new pages are not blank when the user goes to test them. If you build some functionality that requires user interaction, make sure there's an area in the UI for it. simple things.
- Paint catalog will be a few hundred paints initially, then gorwing to thousands. Consider this when designing the UI. 
- You missed half of the reuqirements in the first version so make sure this doesnt happen again.
