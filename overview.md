Is your entire Laravel project now in C:\Claude\wall-planner\?

Laravel project now in "C:\claude\wall-planner\wall-planner"

Can you tell me more about the "paint bundles" concept?

The projects in this web app are murals. We need to be able to shopfor quanities of different paint from the paint catalog. 

The bundles can contain different types of paint. 

How should bundles work? Bundles can be created from projects and can have photos or drawing images attached to them (as some parts of the mural will require different bundles or paint)
Can a project have multiple bundles? Yes
Are bundles like shopping carts for paints? yes

I want each bundle to have a total cost as well as having the project total cost which can show the split between bundles.

All memebers of a project can add or edit the bundles in that project
Bundles need a human readable ID 
CRUD for projct owner or project manager 
CRUD access to bundles as an admin.
A pain view in the project which show all paint for the entire project but with the ability to group paints by bundle


For the project location/maps feature:

Do you just need to store addresses, or show them on an actual map? both.
Do you have a Google Maps API key? how can I get one for this? 


What does your paint CSV look like? you define the CSV format.


Once your project is in the Claude folder, I can immediately:

Fix that blade template error on the users view
Look at your current models and database structure
